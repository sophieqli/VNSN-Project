*Omni-MATH is a comprehensive and challenging benchmark specifically designed to assess LLMs' mathematical reasoning at the Olympiad level. Our dataset focuses exclusively on Olympiad mathematics and comprises a vast collection of 4428 competition-level problems. These problems are meticulously categorized into 33 (and potentially more) sub-domains and span across 10 distinct difficulty levels, enabling a nuanced analysis of model performance across various mathematical disciplines and levels of complexity.*


## üì¢ Repo Info
This repository is a simplified version of Omni-MATH. During our verification process, we found that QwenMATH's evaluation code demonstrates a certain level of robustness. To make our benchmark more user-friendly (eliminating the need for an additional model-based evaluator), we extracted the subset of Omni-MATH problems suitable for rule-based evaluation and made some modifications to the evaluation code of Qwen2.5-MATH. This allows for easier model evaluation.

For detailed filtering methods, please refer to our paper. In brief, we analyzed the reasoning results of multiple models and selected a subset of problems where the models' outputs aligned with rule-based evaluations. Finally, each problem was manually verified to ensure that the answer format is sufficiently simple and clear, making it suitable for rule-based evaluation. 

*Note: The rule-based evaluation are also suitable for evaluating the inference results of other mathematical datasets such as gsm8k and MATH.*

## üë®‚Äçüíª Usage

1. Use VLLM to perform model inference and save the results.
```
bash inference/inference.sh
```

2. Modify the result path.
3. Evaluate the inference results using `evaluation/eval.sh`.
```
bash evaluation/eval.sh
```

## üìä Rule-based Evaluation Results
To validate the correctness of our method, we conducted evaluations on open-source models using this repository. The evaluation results are as follows and **are generally consistent with the results on the Omni-MATH leaderboard(GPT-4o Evaluation)**.
| Model | Rule-based Accuracy |
| --- | --- |
| o1-mini   | 62.2% |
| o1-preview | 51.7% |
| Qwen-QwQ | 49.6% |
| qwen2.5-MATH-72b-Instruct | 36.2% |
| qwen2.5-MATH-7b-Instruct | 32.3% |
| GPT-4o | 29.2% |
| NuminaMATH-72b-cot | 26.2% |
| DeepseekMATH-7b-RL | 14.9% |
